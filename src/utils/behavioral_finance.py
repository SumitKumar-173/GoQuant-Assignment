# Key Behavioral Finance Concepts

## Herding Behavior
- Investors tend to follow the crowd rather than making independent decisions
- Leads to market bubbles and crashes
- Can be detected through sentiment analysis across multiple sources

## Anchoring Bias
- Investors rely too heavily on the first piece of information they see
- Important for understanding how news affects market reactions

## Loss Aversion
- People feel losses more strongly than gains
- Fear indicators should account for this in signal generation

## Overconfidence Effect
- Investors overestimate their knowledge or ability
- Can lead to increased trading volume during positive sentiment periods

# Sentiment Indicators

## Fear and Greed Index
- Measures market sentiment on a scale from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed)
- Components include:
  - Volatility (25%)
  - Market momentum and trading volume (25%)
  - Put and call options (10%)
  - Market breadth (10%)
  - Safe haven demand (10%)
  - Junk bond demand (10%)

## Sentiment Correlation Factors
- Social media sentiment vs. price movements
- News sentiment vs. market volatility
- Retail investor sentiment vs. institutional positions

# Trading Strategies Based on Sentiment

## Contrarian Strategy
- Buy when sentiment is extremely negative (fear)
- Sell when sentiment is extremely positive (greed)
- Works well when sentiment is a contrary indicator

## Momentum Strategy
- Follow the sentiment trend when it aligns with price movement
- Increase position when sentiment and price are confirming each other

## Mean Reversion
- Look for overreactions to sentiment events
- Fade extreme sentiment moves when other indicators suggest exhaustion

# Risk Management Considerations

## Signal Confidence Scoring
- Account for source credibility
- Weight recent sentiment more heavily
- Factor in source volume and diversity

## Position Sizing
- Smaller positions for low-confidence sentiment signals
- Larger positions when sentiment aligns with technical indicators

## Stop Losses
- Use sentiment momentum to determine stop levels
- Avoid being stopped out during temporary sentiment reversals

# Implementation Guidelines

## Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- Short-term sentiment for immediate trading signals
- Medium-term sentiment for position management
- Long-term sentiment for trend confirmation

## Cross-Asset Sentiment Contagion
- Monitor sentiment spillover between related assets
- Adjust signals based on sentiment in correlated markets
- Use sentiment in leading sectors for sector rotation

## Geographic and Demographic Factors
- Different regions may have different sentiment patterns
- Retail vs. institutional sentiment may differ
- Time zone considerations for global markets

# Validation Metrics

## Signal Accuracy
- Percentage of correct directional predictions
- Average return per winning trade
- Sharpe ratio of sentiment-based strategy

## Risk-Adjusted Returns
- Compare sentiment strategy to benchmark
- Analyze maximum drawdown during sentiment-driven periods
- Measure consistency of returns across different market regimes
