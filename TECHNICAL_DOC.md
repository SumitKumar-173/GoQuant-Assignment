# Sentiment Analysis and Trade Signal Generation System - Technical Documentation

## Overview
This system implements a comprehensive solution for analyzing market sentiment from multiple data sources and generating actionable trade signals. It processes real-time data from Twitter, Reddit, news feeds, and financial data sources to provide sentiment scoring and predictive trading signals based on fear and greed indicators.

# System Architecture

## 1. Data Ingestion Layer
The system ingests data from multiple sources:

### Twitter API Client
- Real-time streaming of tweets using Twitter API v2
- Filtering for financial content using predefined keywords and symbols
- User credibility scoring based on verification status and follower count
- Rate limiting and error handling

### Reddit Client
- Streaming from financial subreddits (cryptocurrency, stocks, investing, etc.)
- Post and comment ingestion with engagement metrics
- Content filtering using financial lexicon

### News API Client
- Integration with NewsAPI and Alpha Vantage news sentiment
- Content filtering and credibility scoring based on source quality
- Time-based filtering of recent news

### Financial Data Client
- Market prices and volume data via yfinance
- Economic indicators and market sentiment measures (VIX, etc.)
- Sector performance tracking

## 2. Sentiment Analysis Layer

### SentimentAnalyzer
- Multi-model approach combining:
  - VADER sentiment analysis for social media text
  - FinBERT for financial domain-specific sentiment
  - TextBlob for general sentiment
  - Transformer models (Twitter RoBERTa)
  - Financial lexicon-based scoring
- Sarcasm and irony detection
- Context-aware adjustments based on source credibility

### SentimentProcessor
- Historical sentiment aggregation by timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
- Trend analysis and momentum detection
- Topic trending with sentiment association
- Entity recognition for financial instruments
- Fear and greed index calculation

## 3. Signal Generation Layer

### SignalGenerator
- Multi-factor signal generation combining sentiment with market data
- Contrarian signal generation during extreme sentiment
- Risk management and position sizing
- Signal validation and expiration
- Portfolio impact analysis

### CorrelationEngine
- Sentiment-price correlation analysis with time lags
- Cross-asset sentiment spillover detection
- Fund flow correlation analysis
- Predictive model for price impact
- Correlation breakdown detection

## 4. Main Engine
- Coordination of all system components
- Continuous monitoring of specified symbols
- Performance metrics tracking
- Backtesting capabilities
- Market regime analysis
